        <p>It’s a pie. It’s a cheesecake. Hello, my friends – it’s Rhubarb Cheesecake Pie!</p>
        <p>This incredible rhubarb pie recipe is my own riff on a local restaurant‘s “Rhubarb Delight” pie that our whole family loves. It features an easy pressed-in crust 
            that tastes like a buttery shortbread cookie (so good!!) – and filled with layers of sweet-tart rhubarb and creamy homemade cheesecake, then topped with a thin 
            spread of sweetened sour cream.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy this delightful pie as much as our family does!</p>

        <h3><strong>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</strong></h3>
        <p>This pie has an easy-to-make pressed-in crust that’s filled with 3 distinct layers of deliciousness. As you can see, even with the four different portions, there 
            are still very few ingredients involved!</p>

        <ul>
            <h4>CRUST:</h4>
            <li>⅓ cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon margarine, melted</li>
            <h4>FILLING:</h4>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>HOW TO MAKE THIS MINI CHEESECAKES</strong></h3>
        <p>Let’s break it down, layer by layer. It’s easy, I promise!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 6-cup muffin pan.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and margarine with a fork until combined. Measure a rounded tablespoon of the mixture into the 
                bottom of each muffin cup, pressing firmly. Bake in the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes, then remove to cool. Keep the oven on.</li>
            <li>Beat together the cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla until fluffy. Mix in the egg.</li>
            <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture into the muffin cups, filling each until 3/4 full. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 minutes. Cool completely in pan 
                before removing. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
