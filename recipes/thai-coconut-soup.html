        <h1>THE BEST THAI COCONUT SOUP</h1>

        <p>Our family has always liked eating at Noodles & Company. And one of my favorite dishes, which is no longer on their menu, was their “Thai Hot Pot”. It was a gorgeous 
            coconut curry soup that I found myself craving. Often!</p>
        <p>When the restaurant removed that soup from their menu many years ago, I knew I needed to come up with my own version. I missed it way too much! And when I shared my 
            coconut curry soup recipe here nearly ten years ago, the soup gained many loyal followers.</p>
        <p>I’ve since tweaked the recipe just a bit, after a reader shared how she removed the curry powder and added toasted yellow curry paste instead. I was intrigued to try 
            her suggestion. And she was right. That change did make the soup better, and even more like the original soup from Noodles!</p>
        <p>So I just had to bring this Coconut Curry Chicken Soup recipe back around, and let you know how wonderful it is. It’s lightly creamy with coconut milk, loaded with 
            fresh goodness and flavor. I love it all over again!</p>

        <h3><strong>HOW TO MAKE THAI COCONUT SOUP</strong></h3>
        <p>Because this soup is loaded with fresh produce, chopping is obviously involved. But it’s an easy soup to make. And your house smells absolutely amazing while you’re 
            making it!</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sautée the vegetables & curry paste:</strong> In a large heavy pot over medium heat, heat the oil and butter. Add onion and sauté until softened. Stir 
                in the green curry paste and the yellow curry paste, followed by the garlic, ginger, red bell pepper, and mushrooms. Cook until vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li><strong>Add liquids & chicken: </strong> Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, fish sauce, and chicken. Season with a little brown sugar and red pepper flakes. 
                Cook until thoroughly warmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish & serve: </strong>Stir in lime juice, green onions, and cilantro. Season with kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste. Offer 
                additional lime wedges to squeeze over the top of individual bowls, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
